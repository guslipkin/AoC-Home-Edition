'Twas the day after Christmas, and all through the drifts. The people were playing, enjoying their gifts. Except for your Special Someone! ðŸ˜Ÿ

It's the day after Christmas and you realize you've forgotten to give your special someone that quilt you were planning on making them. In fact, you haven't even started. You find a quilt pattern online which thankfully comes pre-gridded in csv format (your puzzle input) and get to work. The pattern you found has eight colors 
```
red
orange
yellow
green
blue
indigo
violet
white
```

which are condensed to individual letters: ```r paste("r o y g b i v w")```.

The pattern also calls for a fringe around the border of the quilt. This is marked with an `x`.

An example pattern may look like this
```
x	x	x	x	x	x	x	x	x	x
x	b	v	o	o	r	r	b	b	x
x	o	w	o	o	r	r	b	b	x
x	v	v	g	y	y	b	y	y	x
x	v	v	o	y	y	g	y	y	x
x	o	o	w	g	i	y	r	w	x
x	o	o	i	b	r	r	b	b	x
x	g	w	g	i	r	r	b	b	x
x	i	i	v	v	i	i	w	g	x
x	i	i	v	v	i	i	r	v	x
x	v	g	o	y	r	g	y	g	x
x	x	x	x	x	x	x	x	x	x
```

and in color

You're trying to figure out if it is more economical to buy pre-cut square patches of fabric or fabric by the yard. The base of the quilt will be white so you don't need to count those. You want to know ```r paste("how many patches you will need for the quilt")```.

Using the example input, the result would is as follows.

Color | Number of Squares
------- | -------------
red | 5
orange | 5
yellow | 5
green | 9
blue | 5
indigo | 5
violet | 5

To get the answer, you add all the patch counts together (but not white) , which is ```r paste("5 + 5 + 5 + 9 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 39")```. Thus, the answer is `39`.

Of course, your pattern is much larger. ```r paste("How many patches of fabric do you need to make the quilt?")```
