You finally make it home with all the fabric and thread that you'll need and it's time to get to cutting. You want to make as few cuts to the fabric as possible.

For example, you could cut the following bolt of violet as described on the left. This would require 6 vertical and 2 horizontal for a total of 8 cuts. However, if you rearrange the squares to the example on the right, it requires only 5 vertical and 2 horizontal for a total of 7 cuts.
