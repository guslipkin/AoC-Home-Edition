# AoC-Home-Edition

Having failed to do several of the Advent of Code 2020 puzzles, I thought that it might be more fun to create some of my own. In keeping with my mission to solve all of Advent of Code 2020 in R, I decided to write my own puzzles in R.

Inspired by some spreadsheets at work, I got started on my first set, Quilting.

## Quilting
There are five parts to Quilting. Parts 1, 2, and 3 have working solution generators and the story in PDF form. Once I have a working generator for 2.5, I'll add that and a final PDF for the story as well. While there is a story written for part 4, I'm not sure how feasible it is and do not ever see myself writing a solution generator for it.

You are more than welcome to run `FinalGenerator.Rmd` and generate your own input or use one of the pre-made ones in `Quilting/QuiltingForFriends`.

## Notes
For the pre-made `ForFriends` folders, to get to the next part you must unzip the password protected zip folder. Your default un-zip tool may not tell you that it's password protected and simply throw an error.
